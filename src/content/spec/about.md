<<<<<<< HEAD
Bonjour, i'm an *SRE* with experience in Azure Cloud Services, Kubernetes, Terraform, Golang, Ansible and Gitlab + Github CICDs. I am currently working at IT-Challenge part of Simplifi-ED on projects that involve Kubernetes, Gitlab CICD & GitOps, Terraform & Ansible IaC. Outside of work I read mangas and learn about GoLang.
